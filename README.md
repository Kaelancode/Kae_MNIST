# Kaemnist-Mnist_App

#### This is a Digital Recognition App build with Kaerebrum - A machine learning module that i have built from scratch with python using numpy.
MNIST is a very common project and many learner found that can get a high accuracy using a basic neural network, **HOWEVER** it is only because the result are tested on MNIST dataset. The resulting model will perform very badly on actual real world usage . The problem is MNIST dataset are processed images with the digit placed in the middle of the image upright. The produced prediction models will thereby not be able to recognize digits that are written differently slanted slightly or in any way away from the center of the image.

So this model that will be built on augmented data by altering the existing MNIST dataset.
Other feature including 
1. Gellery to save and view predicted the images and validate them - Completed 
2. A validator login to validate the images - TBC
3. Dashboard to provide analytics on the data collected - TBC
